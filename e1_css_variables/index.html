      <p><strong>How did life on Earth begin?</strong> In the nineteenth century, this seemed like an unanswerable question. Researchers attempting to catch life in the act of “spontaneous generation” had come up empty-handed once they learned how to decontaminate their samples.</p>
      <p>As William Thomson (1824–1907), the future Lord Kelvin, put it in an 1871 address before the British Association for the Advancement of Science, “Dead matter cannot become living without coming under the influence of matter previously alive. This seems to me as sure a teaching of science as the law of gravitation.”<span id="ft-1" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">1</sup></span></p>
      <p>Has life somehow <em>always</em> existed, then? Did it arrive on Earth from outer space, borne on an asteroid? Thomson thought so, and some still do. Not that this “panspermia” hypothesis really gets us anywhere. Where did the asteroid come from, and how did life arise <em>there</em>?</p><p>Despite his clear articulation of the principle of evolution, Charles Darwin (1809–1882) didn’t have a clue either. That’s why, in 1863, he wrote to his close friend Joseph Dalton Hooker that “it is mere rubbish, thinking, at present, of origin of life; one might as well think of origin of matter.”<span id="ft-2" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">2</sup></span></p>

      <p>Today, we have more of a clue, although the details may forever be lost to deep time.</p><p>Biologists and chemists working in the field of <span class="wrap-inline">abiogenesis—</span>the study of the moment when, billions of years ago, chemistry became <span class="wrap-inline">life—</span>have developed multiple plausible origin stories. In one, proto-organisms in an ancient “RNA world” were organized around RNA molecules, which could both replicate and fold into 3D structures that could act like primitive enzymes.<span id="ft-3" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">3</sup> </span>In an alternative “metabolism first” account,<span id="ft-4" class="reference"> <sup class="footnote-ref">4</sup> </span>life began without genes, likely in the rock chimneys of “black smokers” on the ocean floor; RNA and DNA came later. It may eventually be possible to rule one or the other theory out … or it may not.</p>
      <p>We’ll return to RNA and replication, but let’s begin by unpacking the metabolism-first version in some detail, as it sheds light on the problem that confounded Darwin and his successors: how evolution can get off the ground without genetic heritability. As we’ll see, abiogenesis becomes less puzzling when we develop a more general understanding of <span class="wrap-inline">evolution—</span>one that can extend back to the time <em>before</em> life.</p>
